🐍 Anurag Singh — Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository, where I showcase various applications, automation scripts, and AI-powered tools built using Python 🧠.
Each project is designed to strengthen my understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving, and real-world applications — from web apps and games to AI, data, and automation tools.

📘 Learning Highlights

Throughout these projects, I’ve explored:

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

✅ Working with APIs (FastAPI, Gemini AI)

✅ File handling & data automation using Pandas

✅ GUI creation using Tkinter

✅ Building small AI logic (minimax, scoring systems)

✅ Integrating Python with JS for full-stack use cases

Would you like me to:

Generate this as a downloadable README.md file (ready to upload to your repo), and

Auto-create individual mini-README templates for each of your Python projects (TicTacToe, RockPaperScissors, Expense Tracker, etc.)?
